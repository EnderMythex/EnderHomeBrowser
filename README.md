## Description

This project is a Chrome extension named "EnderHomeBrowser" developed by EnderMythex. It customizes the new tab page with a sleek, modern design featuring a sidebar with quick access to popular search engines like Google, Brave, and Bing. The extension includes a digital clock, a performance monitor displaying CPU and memory usage, and a storage information panel. It also tracks and displays recently visited sites, which can be toggled on or off. The extension utilizes Chrome's system APIs to provide real-time updates on system performance and storage, and it sends notifications when the extension is installed or when a new storage device is connected. The user interface is styled with a dark theme and uses a custom digital font for the clock.
